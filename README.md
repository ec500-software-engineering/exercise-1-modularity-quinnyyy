# EC500 Health Monitor System
To run it: ```python3 main.py```

User should input the intervals for each measurement to tell the GUI how often to update.

gui2 effectively acts as main.py so i just import it in main.py and call runUI with ask_intervals

I wasn't sure how encryption/decryption modules worked so I just omitted those in my design.

I added ask_intervals module in my design.
